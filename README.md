# CMOS-Power-Oscillator-Test-Chip
A CMOS 915 MHz power oscillator test chip consists of a driving cross coupled LC oscillator followed by a differential power amplifier is designed to compare the performance of three classes of power amplifiers (C, E and F). The key performance metrics are efficiency and output power level. The target application is far field wireless charging applications.
